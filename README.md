# Lyrics-Analysis
Implementation of Song Lyrics analysis. 
This was originally created in December 2021 by Ameya Naik MIMS '23 as a final project for INFO 202: Information Organization and Retrieval.

# Introduction 
Petrusich's piece ![“Genre is Disappearing, What Comes Next?”](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/03/15/genre-is-disappearing-what-comes-next) on musical genres made me wonder: how do artists use the same words differently? When classroom(![Info202](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/info/202)UC Berkeley very interesting course do check it out!) discussion of the topic of document level embedding and document-vectors made me wonder, “how can document-level embedding help distinguish differences between artists?”.For my final project, I combined these concepts in an implementation project. Specifically, I investigated how effectively document-level embedding tells us which artists' song lyrics are similar, and whether this approach aligns or contradicts to methods of genre categorization.

# Project Concepts
These were the concepts covered in this project(I enjoyed learning further)
## 1. Genre Classification: 
The concepst of genre is very vague and rely heavily on the feeling. I feel labelling an artist to a genre is restricting and dis-respectful to the art. The genre classification and song categorisation as binary is uncreative. The "Protoype Theory"![Read more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_theory) , is really an interesting way to understanding the songs and the concept of genre. Since lot of time songs could lie in fuzziness for different genre. Like the "Bohemian Rapsody" by queens could be more towards rock in comparison to Careless whisper(it's often labelled as yatch rock), or is very less rock in comparison to "Thunderstruck" by AC/DC. Hence genre classification is more in relative terms rather than absolute hence the concepts of distance between artist and their lyrics could provide how close ther are to each other.
